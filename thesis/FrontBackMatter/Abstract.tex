Emotions and sentiment are an essential part of what makes us human. While psychology has tried to differentiate between certain emotions, past work on sentiment analysis has focused primarily on classifying sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. In the following, we use Plutchik's eight base emotions, i.e. anger, anticipation, joy, fear, surprise, disgust, sadness, and trust. We collect patterns that are indicative of said emotions from a diverse set of sentiment resources. Using these patterns, we extract emotion holders and causes from the Gigaword corpus using the Annotated Gigaword API. Distributional analyses of the extractions produce words that evoke certain emotions.
