Annotation of emotions
Please annotate the following expressions with the most closely associated emotion and its degree among the following:
Joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation.
Please keep Plutchik's wheel of emotions (http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Plutchikfig6.gif) visible while undertaking this task to assist you in differentiating the emotions.
Please also specify the degree of emotion on Plutchik's wheel like this: joy_I (inner wheel), joy_II (middle wheel), joy_III (outer wheel).
If an expression clearly pertains to only emotion, assign just one. If no emotion can be clearly associated with an expression, label it with 'none'. If you associate two emotions with an expression, assign the most and the second-most closely associated emotion. Delimit expressions and emotions with tabs.
E.g. funfair   joy_II
pessimist  sadness_III fear_III
Please annotate only the first 30-40 patterns at the beginning. After these, we will meet briefly to discuss problems and ambiguities. Thank you for your time!
