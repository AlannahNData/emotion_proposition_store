# Working plan Bachelor's thesis on sentiment analysis

## Steps

1. Compile list of emotion-triggering expression patterns.
2. Match emotion-triggering expression patterns on subset of corpus locally using GW API.
3. Deploy program on ella remote server using Hadoop/MapReduce.
4. Analyse high-scoring single vs. compound emotion-triggering expressions.
5. Store emotion-triggering expressions in proposition store as triples (similar to TextRunner, KnowItAll). 


10. Evaluate against existing emotion-labeled resources, e.g. Borth et al. (2013), Mohammad and Turney (2011).
11. (optional:) Apply approach to other domains
11. (optional, MA only:) Link acquired expressions to an emotion-annotated ontology
12. (optional, MA only:) Generalize to near-synonyms of emotion-bearing expressions in the distributional space


aim: implement a keyword-based approach for acquiring a proposition store of emotion-tagged state-of-affairs, focusing on linguistic constructs that clearly identify the emotion holder (subject) and the target.
processing: filtering, parsing, and storing of acquired propositions in a proposition store or distributional space, parameterized according to the basic emotion classes
analysis: analysis of the proposition store or semantic space of the acquired propositions will yield the contributing single vs. compound emotion-triggering expressionsgoal:  distributional analysis of the component expressions will allow us to determine high-scoring single- vs. compound emotion-triggering expressions.
However, emotion (just as sentiment) expression is a compositional phenomenon. E.g. neither prize nor go up are by themselves emotion-triggering words; but compositional expressions such as the price went up or rising prices are prone to trigger emotions -- which may be anger, fear or even joy (depending on the holder of emotion and the context).
Next to automatic extraction of a (compositional) emotion lexicon, this method can be applied to special domain corpora, to learn about what are the things and actions people love, hate, fear or wish for, and where their emotions differ.
